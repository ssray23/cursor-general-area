## Instructions

### STEP 1: Marinate the Chicken (30 mins - 2 hours)
1. In a large bowl, combine chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, salt, red chilli powder, and turmeric
2. Mix well, ensuring every piece is coated
3. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to 2 hours for maximum tenderness)
4. **Pro tip:** Bring to room temperature 15 minutes before cooking

### STEP 2: Build the Umami Base - Caramelize Onions (15-20 mins)
> **This is the secret to restaurant-quality curry!**

1. Heat ghee/oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or kadhai over **medium-high heat**
2. Add whole spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, cumin seeds, peppercorns)
3. Let them sizzle for 20-30 seconds until fragrant
4. Add sliced onions immediately
5. **Cook onions for 15-20 minutes**, stirring frequently:
   - First 5 mins: soften and reduce in volume
   - Next 10 mins: turn golden
   - Final 5 mins: deep golden brown (not burnt!)
6. **Don't rush this step** - this is where 50% of your umami comes from

### STEP 3: Add Aromatics (3-4 mins)
1. Lower heat to **medium**
2. Add green chillies and additional ginger-garlic paste
3. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until raw smell disappears
4. If it starts sticking, add 1-2 tbsp water

### STEP 4: Layer the Spices (2-3 mins)
1. Add all ground spices: coriander, cumin, red chilli, turmeric
2. **Bhuna (sauté) for 2-3 minutes**, stirring constantly
3. Add 2-3 tbsp water if needed to prevent burning
4. The oil should start separating from the masala - this is the sign of a well-cooked base

### STEP 5: Add Marinated Chicken (10-12 mins)
1. Increase heat to **medium-high**
2. Add all marinated chicken with the yogurt marinade
3. Mix well to coat chicken with masala
4. **Bhuna (fry) the chicken for 10-12 minutes**, stirring frequently:
   - This is crucial for flavor depth
   - The chicken will release moisture - let it cook off
   - Keep frying until oil begins to separate again
   - Chicken should be lightly seared and coated with thick masala

### STEP 6: Add Liquid & Simmer (20-25 mins)
1. Add **1-1½ cups hot water** (depending on desired gravy consistency)
2. Add salt and sugar
3. Bring to a boil, then reduce to **medium-low**
4. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes until chicken is tender and oil floats on top
   - Bone-in chicken needs this time to release collagen
   - Stir occasionally to prevent sticking

### STEP 7: Finish with Yogurt (5 mins)
1. **Whisk ¼ cup yogurt** until smooth in a small bowl
2. Lower heat to low
3. Add yogurt gradually, **1 tablespoon at a time**, stirring continuously
4. Simmer gently for 5 minutes (don't boil vigorously or yogurt will split)
5. Add garam masala
6. **Optional:** Add 1-2 tbsp cream for extra richness

### STEP 8: Garnish & Rest
1. Garnish with fresh coriander
2. Turn off heat and **let it rest for 5-10 minutes** (flavors meld)
3. Serve hot with rice, naan, or roti

## Umami Maximization Tips

### The 5 Umami Boosters in This Recipe:
1. **Caramelized onions** - natural glutamates develop during long cooking
2. **Bone-in chicken** - marrow and collagen add depth
3. **Yogurt** - fermented dairy = natural MSG-like compounds
4. **Long bhuna technique** - concentrates and intensifies flavors
5. **Spice layering** - whole spices at start, ground spices mid-way, garam masala at end

### Critical Success Factors:
- ✅ **Don't rush the onions** - 15-20 minutes minimum
- ✅ **Don't skip the bhuna** - frying the chicken in masala is essential
- ✅ **Use bone-in chicken** - boneless won't give the same depth
- ✅ **Let it rest** - flavors intensify after cooking
- ❌ **Don't add too much water** - thin curry = weak flavor
- ❌ **Don't skip the sugar** - it balances acidity and rounds out flavors

## Troubleshooting

### Curry too thick?
- Add hot water, 2-3 tbsp at a time, and simmer for 5 minutes

### Curry too thin?
- Simmer uncovered on medium heat until desired consistency
- Or add 2 tbsp yogurt whisked with 1 tsp flour

### Curry too spicy?
- Add more yogurt and/or cream
- Add ½ tsp more sugar

### Curry too tart/acidic?
- Add ½-1 tsp sugar
- Add 2-3 tbsp cream
- Simmer longer to mellow acidity

### Not enough umami/depth?
- Your onions weren't caramelized enough - cook longer next time
- Add a small pinch of MSG (controversial but effective!)
- Add 1 tsp tomato paste for extra savory depth
- Let it rest longer (even overnight in fridge improves flavor)

## Variations & Additions

### Optional Umami Boosters:
- **1 tbsp tomato paste** (not fresh tomatoes!) - adds concentrated umami without tartness
- **1 tbsp cashew paste** - richness and body
- **Pinch of kasuri methi** (dried fenugreek leaves) - adds depth, crush and add at end
- **Splash of lemon juice** - brightens at the very end

### Make It Your Own:
- **Spicier:** Add more green chillies or ½ tsp cayenne
- **Richer:** Use equal parts ghee and butter
- **Tangier:** Add 1 tsp amchur (dried mango powder) at end
- **Restaurant-style:** Add 2 tbsp cream and 1 tsp kasuri methi at the end

## Storage

- **Refrigerator:** 3-4 days in airtight container
- **Freezer:** Up to 2 months
- **Reheating tip:** Tastes even better the next day! Add splash of water when reheating

## The Science of Umami in This Curry

**Glutamates (natural MSG) are created when:**
- Onions are slowly caramelized (Maillard reaction)
- Proteins break down during long cooking
- Yogurt fermentation produces amino acids
- Bone marrow releases collagen

**The bhuna technique** drives off moisture and concentrates these compounds, creating that "can't quite put your finger on it" deliciousness that defines restaurant curries.

**Enjoy your deeply flavorful, umami-packed chicken curry!** 🍛

*Pro tip: Make a double batch - this curry is always better the next day, and it freezes beautifully.*
